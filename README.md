# Power-BI-Sales-Insight-Project


* Our case study is based on a computer hardware business which is facing challenges in dynamically changing market. Sales director decides to invest in data analysis project and he would like to build power BI dashboard that can give him real time sales insights.

* Once AIMS grid is defined, next step is data discovery. In this step, data analyst team approaches IT team within an organization who owns software system that keep track of sales records. These records are stored in mysql database. Power BI can be plugged to this database to pull necessary information required for data analysis. I also discuss ETL, OLTP, OLAP and data warehouse concepts. Many times we need separate data warehouse or OLAP system to run our data analytics queries but in our project we will directly use mysql database.

* This database has all sales transactions, customers, products, and market information. We will analyse this database and then hook it up with power BI. In power BI we will perform ETL and data cleaning operations to make it ready so that we can build our dashboard.

* The final dashboard was effective at displaying the sales trend of Atliq hardware, allowing users to understand the data and make informed decisions.
